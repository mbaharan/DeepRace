# Deep Learning Reliability Awareness of Converters at the Edge (Deep RACE)
![POWERED BY TeCSAR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Deep_RACE/master/logo/tecsarPowerBy.png)

Deep RACE is a real-time reliability modeling and assessment of power semiconductor devices embedded into a wide range of smart power electronics systems. Deep RACE presents a scalable solution based on two deep learning algorithms that departures from classical and statistical modeling to deep learning-based data analytics. We leverage two states of the art algorithms for time series prediction named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to aggregate reliability modeling of the power converters with the same underlying physics.

  
## Installation
You only need to clone the Deep RACE repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbaharan/DeepRace
```
The following instructions are for the TCN model. For LSTM model you should switch the branch to LSTM by:
```bash
cd DeepRace
git checkout LSTM
```
Please follow the instruction in `README.md` of the `LSTM` branch to train and run inference for the LSTM model.

## Prerequisites
First make sure you have already installed pip3, Tkinter, and git tools:
``` bash
sudo apt install git python3-pip python3-tk
```
You should also install the following python packages:
```bash
sudo -H pip3 install scipy matplotlib seaborn numpy torch sklearn glob shutil
pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/sovrasov/flops-counter.pytorch.git
```

## Training the network models
Change the path to the `DeepRACE` directory and run the `train.py`:
```bash
cd DeepRace
python3 train.py --epochs 600 --nhid 15 --ksize 7 --levels 3 --testset 0 --dropout 0
```
There is a training script in ./scripts/train1.sh for ease of use.

The training will generate a file:`output/train/<Time-Date-TCN-model-specs/args.yaml` that will be used in in the next step for inference.

For seeing the list of devices, you can run the program with `--help`.


All the training models will be saved automatically in `./output/train/<Time-Date-TCN-model-specs>` folder. You can load them by running the `inference.py` file.

### Prediction output
Running `inference.py` file generates and saves the prediction output in a text file. The file name is based on the selected MOSFET device number. For instance, a text file with the name of `./output/train/<Time-Date-TCN-model-specs>/RUL_Dev_14.txt` will be generated for `dev#14`.

### Testing different MOSFET devices
You can test different devices from `dR11Devs.mat` by altering `--testset` argument.

### RUL
For extracting the RUL at different time, you need to run the `inference.py` as follows:
```bash
./inference.py --config output/train/<Time-Date-TCN-model-specs/args.yaml  --rul-time 130 139 151 161 170 175 180 185 189
```
The results will be generated in the same folder as the model (plot, errors, etc)
